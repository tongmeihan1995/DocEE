DocEE: A Large-Scale and Fine-grained Benchmark for Document-level Event Extraction


# Introduction
DocEE, a new document-level event extraction dataset including 27,000+ events, 180,000+ arguments. DocEE has three features: large- scale manual annotations, fine-grained argument types and application-oriented settings.

Our academic paper which describes DocEE in detail and provides full event ontology can be found here: https://tongmeihan1995.github.io/meihan.github.io/research/NAACL2022.pdf.

# Dataset Display
DocEE focus on the extraction of the main event, that is one-event-per-document.
